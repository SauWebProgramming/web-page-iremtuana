    <p id="text1"> The Quinx Squad (クインクス班, Kuinkusu-han) or Qs Squad is a squad affiliated to Mado Squad that consists entirely of Quinx. The Quinx members are referred to as humans with built-in quinque in their bodies, drawing a distinction between them and normal one-eyed ghouls. The members are regarded as human research subjects who have undergone the surgical procedure developed by Dr. Kouitsu Chigyou. The tasks assigned to the Quinx were often monitored and overseen by Haise Sasaki until he resigned as their mentor.[1] They all currently reside in a house called The Chateau, located in the 1st ward.

        Though the squad has proficiently skilled ghoul investigators, the Quinx members often face prejudice and discrimination from higher-class investigators, such as the Hirako Squad, who accuse them of being incompetent and sloppy at doing their work, rendering Haise Sasaki as the primary cause. However, after the Auction Mopping-up Operation their reputation greatly improved, leading to discussion of expanding their ranks.[2] After the Tsukiyama Family Extermination Operation their reputation further increased and the squad welcomed new members.</p>
