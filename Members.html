    <p id="text1" align:"left">Ken Kaneki (金木 研) is the main protagonist of the Tokyo Ghoul series. He is currently Touka Kirishima's husband, and the father of Ichika Kaneki. Previously, he was a student who studied Japanese literature at Kamii University, living a relatively normal life. However, this quickly changed after Rize Kamishiro's kakuhou was transplanted into him and transformed him into a one-eyed ghoul. Kaneki is the first known artificial one-eyed ghoul. His unique half ghoul state is what later inspires the idea of the Quinx. After joining Anteiku as a part-time waiter, he learns how to live as a ghoul and eventually becomes known as Eyepatch (眼帯, Gantai).

        After being captured by Aogiri Tree, he underwent a drastic personality change and after escaping, formed a group with the goal of protecting those precious to him and exterminating individuals threatening his place of belonging. His kakuja form's distinct appearance earned him the alias Centipede (ムカデ, Mukade).[14]
        
        Two years following his defeat against Kishou Arima, he lived under the identity of Haise Sasaki (佐々木 琲世, Sasaki Haise), a Rank 1 Ghoul Investigator who served as the mentor of the CCG's Quinx Squad. His memories were initially lost to him, but regained during the Tsukiyama Family Extermination Operation. Six months after the operation, ghouls came to know him by the moniker of the Black Reaper (黒い死神, Kuroi Shinigami).</p>
     <!--Kuki Urie-->
    <h2> Kuki Urie (瓜江 久生) </h2>
    <img src="original.jpg" width="450px">
    <p id="text1">Kuki Urie is an Associate Special Class Ghoul Investigator, a Quinx, and the squad leader and mentor of the Quinx Squad, as well as the leader of the S2 Squad.Urie is a slender young man of average height, with purple hair styled into an undercut and dark triangular eyes with unique diamond-shaped irises. Urie also has two distinct moles below his left eye. He usually wears his CCG uniform consisting of the formal suit , black shirt and tie, along with a white trench coat pulled over when a mission beckons. He is also seen wearing black gloves. Aside from this attire, Urie is often wearing earphones. Like most ghoul investigators, he occasionally carries a briefcase with him</p>
    <!--Tooru Mutsuki-->
    <h2>Tooru Mutsuki(六月 透)</h2>
    <img src="mutsuki-2.jpg" width="450px">
    <p id="text1">Tooru Mutsuki is a Special Class Ghoul Investigator in a rural branch office of the CCG, a Quinx, and a former member of the Quinx Squad and the TSC. Following the Tsukiyama Family Extermination Operation, he was re-assigned to Support for other squads during their missions. He has served as a temporary member of the Hachikawa and Suzuya Squads during major operations.

      He acted as a mentor to the Oggai Squads and supported their mission as the Zero Squad, up until his department from the CCG alongside Shinsanpei Aura, in order to personally seek out his former mentor, Ken Kaneki.
      
      Eventually, Mutsuki returns to the CCG amidst the guidance of Urie and Saiko before ultimately departing from the TSC (née CCG) again to transfer to a rural branch office alongside Shinsanpei Aura and Ayumu Hogi.</p>
    <!--Ginshi Shirazu-->
    <h2> Ginshi Shirazu (不知 吟士)</h2>
    <img src="shirazu-2jpg.jpg" width="450px">
    <p id="text1">Ginshi Shirazu was a Rank 2 Ghoul Investigator, a Quinx, and squad leader of the Quinx Squad.
      
      Shirazu was a slender young man with light orange hair. He usually wore a menacing grin on his face and had sharp, jagged teeth. He also had six-helix piercings on his right ear, one piercing on his left ear, and wore a ring on the middle finger of his right hand. Unlike the other members of the Quinx Squad, he wore a dark jumpsuit instead of the standard CCG uniform and used a motorcycle to commute during missions. His hair was unusually long for a CCG officer and almost reached his shoulders with two strands of hair parted and tied up at the top of his head. Eventually, he completely buzzed his hair off in an act of repentance.</p>
    <!--Saiko Yonebayashi-->
    <h2> Saiko Yonebayashi (米林 才子)  </h2>
    <img src="yonebayashi.jpg" width="450px">
    <p id="text1">Saiko Yonebayashi is a Rank 2 Ghoul Investigator, a Quinx, and the deputy squad leader of the Quinx Squad.

      Saiko has two thick sections of hair worn in pigtails with uneven fringed bangs, possibly as a result of her laziness. Her kakugan is located in her left eye because of her status as a Quinx, and her face appears rather youthful; Saiko is a bit heavier than the average CCG agent, with notably thick and chubby legs. She is very short, especially for her age. She has light pale blue colored hair. Her right eye is a bright baby blue color while her left eye is bright red.
      
      Six months after the Tsukiyama Family Extermination Operation, Saiko's hair is shorter.</p>
